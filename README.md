This is a very standard calculator program.  It is the product of 2 weeks of iterations, starting with a program overflowing with disgusting code defiant of the DRY principle, committed to flaunting globals wherever possible.  I looked at many other examples of calculators out there, watched online tutorials, then wrote an acceptable program.  I then tried to go off on a tangent making it more complicated than need be.  All in all, I've written and erased several iterations of the calculator, before settling with this for now.  Perhaps I'll return in the future to make improvements.

This has been a great learning experience.  I think I've finished with something that is clean and easily readable.  I've learned some new commands, and am more comfortable with the type of interchange between the expressions, digits & operators, and resulting labels.  For any experienced programmer, or for a future me, I know this is probably tantamount to a child proud of a graham cracker house he built in arts&crafts class.  Through it all, I hope you can appreciate the pursuit of excellence that went into this graham cracker house, and look forward to popsickle-stick castles to come.
